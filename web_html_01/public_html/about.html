                     <p align="justify" > <b> <i>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</i></b> is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted in a file intended for 
                         display on a <mark style="font:italic; background-color: red; color: yellow" >World Wide Web browser</mark> page. The markup tells the Web browser how to display a Web page's words and 
                         images for the user. Each individual markup code is referred to as an element (but many people also refer to it as a tag). 
                         Some elements come in pairs that indicate when some display effect is to begin and when it is to end.
                         More and more organizations looking to hop on the cloud wagon are facing application and data integration roadblocks. Getting around them is difficult
                         but possibleâ€”and a step-by-step approach can help.
                         HTML is a formal Recommendation by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and is generally adhered to by the major browsers, Microsoft's Internet Explorer and 
                         Netscape's Navigator, which also provide some additional non-standard codes. The current version of HTML is HTML 4.0. However, both Internet Explorer and Netscape implement some features differently and provide non-standard extensions. Web developers using the more advanced features of HTML 4 may have to design pages for both browsers and send out the appropriate version to a user. Significant features in HTML 4 are sometimes described in general as dynamic HTML. What is sometimes referred to as HTML 5 is an extensible form of HTML called Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML).
